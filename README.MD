# autoao
To do stuff, execute auto like this:
./auto [type] (f) [pastebinids]
Where [type] is Repl for discord and Replp for pesterchum, (f) is an optional argument that, when given, makes [pastebinids] a list of files to read unformatted logs from, and [pastebinids] is a list of space-seperated 8-letter pastebin url ids.
It will output a link to the formatted log. Requires netcat, curl, cat, echo, a /tmp directory, sh, and java.
